This exercise will take some concepts discussed in Orem et al. (2011) and apply them to an alpine wetland ecosystem.

Alpine wetlands are very fascinating systems. Although they may look different than the lowland wetlands you are used to, I hypothesize that they are key control points in the alpine ecosystem. You are working up at Niwot Ridge, sampling wetlands of 3 distinct types: alpine wet meadows (AWMs), subalpine wetlands (SAWs), and periglacial solifluction lobes(PSLs). You are interested in whether long-range transport of sulfur in aerosols through wet deposition is significantly raising the natural levels of sulfur in these systems. You remember the findings of Orem et al. (2011), who found that at low sulfate concentrations, you can track the source of sulfate in wetland surface water. 

```{r "load packages", include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Part 1: Determining Sulfur Source

You measure the following sulfate concentrations [mg/L] and $\delta^{34}S$ values [permil] in the surface water of each wetland type. 
```{r}
d34S_awm_surf <- 2.96
d34S_psl_surf <- 5.01
d34S_saw_surf <- 3.42
conc_awm <- 3.4
conc_psl <- 3.0
conc_saw <- 6.2

s_data <- tibble(
  type = c("AWM", "PSL","SAW"),
  concentration = c(conc_awm, conc_psl, conc_saw), #mg/L
  d34S = c(d34S_awm_surf, d34S_psl_surf, d34S_saw_surf), #permil
)

s_data
```

Due to the dearth of information on sulfur isotopes in alpine wetlands, you turn to the wetland literature and find the following figure in Orem et al. (2011):

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("everglades.png")
```

## 1A: Identifying Sources

Looking at your wetlands, they don't receive any canal discharge, but there are runoff inputs flowing downslope, mostly from snowmelt. Therefore, your total mass balance equation for the isotopic composition of surface sulfate in each wetland becomes:

$$
\delta^{34}S_{surface} = f_{precip} \cdot \delta_{precip} + f_{shallow} \cdot \delta_{shallow} + f_{deep} \cdot \delta_{deep} + f_{runoff} \cdot \delta_{runoff}
$$

## 1B: Some Helpful Information

In doing some further research into the types of wetlands, you discover a few important pieces of information (let's call them Helpful Hints):
1. PSLs have an underlying ice lens, effectively cutting them off from groundwater inputs
2. SAWs lay downslope below treeline, so receive runoff from the AWM and PSL.
3. All systems are close together, so will have the same total sulfate concentration input from precipitation.
4. You measure the $\delta_{34}S$ of the precipitation to be +5 per mil. 
5. Due to the depth of the water table, sulfate in deep groundwater takes a very long time to diffuse to the surface, and will only contribute 1% of the sulfate in the surface pool if not cut off.

### Q: With the following information, which sources will likely be the primary contributors to each wetland type?
  PSLs: precip
  AWMs: precip + groundwater
  SAWs: runoff + groundwater
  
## 1C: Sulfur Isotope Fractionation in Shallow vs. Deep Groundwater

Let's just say that the fractionation factor $\alpha$ for microbial sulfate reduction to sulfide is 0.96. 
$$
\alpha_{HS^- / SO_4^{2-}} = \frac{\delta^{34}S_{HS^-} + 1}{\delta^{34}S_{SO_4^{2-}} + 1} = 0.96
$$
We can use this equation to estimate $\delta^{34}S$ values for shallow groundwater and deep groundwater.

For shallow groundwater, let's assume that 35% of the sulfur is diffused sulfate in oxic pore spaces, and 65% is sulfide that has been reduced once by SRB.
For deep groundwater, let's assume that 5% of the sulfur is diffused sulfate in oxic pore spaces, and 95% is sulfide that has been reduced by SRB in shallow groundwater, re-oxidized, and then reduced again. 

In the chunk below, calculate the $\delta^{34}S$ value of both shallow and deep groundwater for each system.

```{r}
d34S_precip <- 5.0

d34S_awm_sgw <- (0.65 * ((0.96 * (d34S_awm_surf/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.35 * d34S_awm_surf
d34S_psl_sgw <- (0.65 * ((0.96 * (d34S_psl_surf/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.35 * d34S_psl_surf
d34S_saw_sgw <- (0.65 * ((0.96 * (d34S_saw_surf/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.35 * d34S_saw_surf

d34S_awm_dgw <- (0.95 * ((0.96 * (d34S_awm_sgw/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.05 * d34S_awm_surf
d34S_psl_dgw <- (0.95 * ((0.96 * (d34S_psl_sgw/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.05 * d34S_psl_surf
d34S_saw_dgw <- (0.95 * ((0.96 * (d34S_saw_sgw/1000 + 1)) - 1) * 1000) + 0.05 * d34S_saw_surf
```

## 1D: Mini Mass Balance for Runoff

Now to estimate the isotopic compositions of the runoff. 
Runoff flowing into PSLs and AWMs is direct snowmelt. Only a small fraction of the snowmelt has been reduced and sequestered in the soil, leaving the runoff enriched wrt precipitation by +0.05 permil.
Runoff going into the SAW is 10% snowmelt, 45% water that has drained from the AWM, and 45% water that has drained from the PSL.
Calculate the isotopic compositions of runoff coming into each wetland type in the chunk below: 

```{r}
d34S_awm_runoff <- d34S_precip + 0.05
d34S_psl_runoff <- d34S_precip + 0.05
d34S_saw_runoff <- 0.1 * d34S_precip + 0.45 * d34S_awm_surf + 0.45 * d34S_psl_surf

d34S_saw_runoff
```


Based on this information, you can fill out your table a bit further:

```{r}
s_data <- s_data %>%
  mutate(
    precip_d34S = d34S_precip,
    sgw_d34S = c(d34S_awm_sgw, d34S_psl_sgw, d34S_saw_sgw), 
    dgw_d34S = c(d34S_awm_dgw, d34S_psl_dgw, d34S_saw_dgw),
    runoff_d34S = c(d34S_awm_runoff, d34S_psl_runoff, d34S_saw_runoff)
  )

s_data
```
  
## 1D: Calculating the Contributions

Yay you have all the delta values! Now we're going to determine the fractional contributions from each source.
Determine the missing fractional contributions of sulfate from each potential source in the chunk below. Remember to look at the Helpful Hints!

```{r}
f_psl_runoff <- (d34S_psl_surf - d34S_precip)/(d34S_psl_runoff - d34S_precip)
f_psl_sgw <- 0
f_psl_dgw <- 0
f_psl_precip <- 1 - f_psl_runoff
f_psl_runoff
f_psl_precip

f_awm_precip <- f_psl_precip * conc_psl / conc_awm
f_awm_dgw <- 0.01
f_awm_runoff <- (- d34S_awm_surf + f_awm_dgw * d34S_awm_dgw + f_awm_precip * d34S_precip + (1 - f_awm_dgw - f_awm_precip) * d34S_awm_sgw) / (d34S_awm_sgw - d34S_awm_runoff)
f_awm_sgw <- 1 - f_awm_precip - f_awm_dgw - f_awm_runoff
f_awm_precip
f_awm_runoff
f_awm_sgw

f_saw_precip <- f_psl_precip * conc_psl / conc_saw
f_saw_dgw <- 0.01
f_saw_runoff <- (- d34S_saw_surf + f_saw_dgw * d34S_saw_dgw + f_saw_precip * d34S_precip + (1 - f_saw_dgw - f_saw_precip) * d34S_saw_sgw) / (d34S_saw_sgw - d34S_saw_runoff)
f_saw_sgw <- 1 - f_saw_precip - f_saw_dgw - f_saw_runoff
f_saw_precip
f_saw_runoff
f_saw_sgw
```


## Visualize it:
```{r}
awm <- data.frame(
  type = c(rep("AWM", 4), rep("PSL", 4), rep("SAW", 4)),
  source = c(rep(c("Runoff", "Precip", "Shallow GW", "Deep GW"), 3)),
  value = c(f_awm_runoff, f_awm_precip, f_awm_sgw, f_awm_dgw, f_psl_runoff, f_psl_precip, f_psl_sgw, f_psl_dgw, f_saw_runoff, f_saw_precip, f_saw_sgw, f_saw_dgw)
)

ggplot(awm, aes(x = "", y = value, group = source, color = source, fill = source)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1, color = "white") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  facet_wrap(~ type) +
  theme_void()
```

### Does this make sense, given the background information provided?

Answer: Yes, because wetlands above treeline get most of their water from snowmelt, while the subalpine serves as a gateway for runoff draining into the greater watershed.

Orem et al. (2011) suggest implementation of a numeric water quality criteria to control sulfate loading for ecosystem protection. They suggest <1 mg/L sulfate, based on concentrations found in natural wetlands. Regardless of other sources of sulfate to Niwot wetlands, are the concentrations contributed by sulfur in wet deposition low enough to meet this standard? Remember that total sulfate concentration from precipitation should be the same in all 3 wetland types.

```{r}
total_conc_awm <- f_awm_precip * conc_awm
total_conc_psl <- f_psl_precip * conc_psl
total_conc_saw <- f_saw_precip * conc_saw

total_conc_awm
```

What are some potential sources of sulfate in the wet deposition falling on Niwot Ridge?

Answer: Industrial activities in Denver, fossil fuel emissions, etc.
